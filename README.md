# Machine-Learning--Stanford-Coursera-

These MATLAB project files are my worked solutions for a popular Coursera Machine Learning course taught by a Stanford professor. 

Per the Coursera honor code policy, the files are password protected.

Courseraâ€™s Honor Code states:

"You may not share your solutions to homework, quizzes, or exams with anyone else unless explicitly permitted by the instructor. This includes anything written by you, as well as any official solutions provided by the course staff.

So, If you would like to use an assignment Notebook/solution as part of your portfolio, you need to observe the following

Avoid specifying the course and assignment name
Avoid uploading the code to non-password protected remote version control sites like github and bitbucket.
Provide images of the code rather than text"
